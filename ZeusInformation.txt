Contents

This introductory course is exclusively designed for first-semester MA SEDS students, aiming to provide a solid foundation in Python programming. 
It consists of hands-on sessions that cover theoretical and technical aspects of programming with Python and practical sessions where participants directly apply their acquired knowledge.
Students will learn fundamental programming concepts such as variables, control flow, basic data structures, and functions, and will also learn how to use Python to load, manipulate, and visualize data. 
Successfully completing this course will enable students to apply these skills to basic data analysis and programming in other courses and will help them develop more advanced, domain-specific Python skills.

Prerequisites

Before starting the block course, students should install the Jupyter environment or another IDE that allows them to follow the course. Instructions are sent over email before the course and on the online materials. We recommend the students to familiarize themselves with the basics of coding in the Jupyter environment before the course starts.

Mandatory requirement

This course is exclusively for students of the Master's Programme in Social and Economic Data Science.

Remark

This course is exclusively for students of the Master's Programme in Social and Economic Data Science.

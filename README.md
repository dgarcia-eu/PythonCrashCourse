# Introduction to Programming with Python
[David Garcia](http://dgarcia.eu)

Welcome to the online materials for the Python Crash Course at SEDS.

This introductory course is exclusively designed for first-semester MA SEDS students, aiming to provide a solid foundation in Python programming. 
It consists of hands-on sessions that cover theoretical and technical aspects of programming with Python and practical sessions where participants directly apply their acquired knowledge.
Students will learn fundamental programming concepts such as variables, control flow, basic data structures, and functions, and will also learn how to use Python to load, manipulate, and visualize data. 
Successfully completing this course will enable students to apply these skills to basic data analysis and programming in other courses and will help them develop more advanced, domain-specific Python skills.
The course does not follow a specific textbook but useful references are "Learn Python the Hard Way" by Zed Shaw and "Introduction to Python" by Eric Matthes.

**Time and place in WS 2025/26: K503, October 13-17, 2025, 9:00 - 17:00**

## Course contents

### Day 0

Before starting the block course, students should install the Jupyter environment or another IDE that allows them to follow the course.

## Course grading

- The course is graded as pass/fail. To pass the course, you need the following:
  - **Pass each of the five daily assignments (at least 50% points in each)**
  - **Pass the final written exam (at least 50% points)**

- During the daily sessions, we will do small ungraded quizzes as practice for the final written exam.
- Attendance is not mandatory but highly recommended to pass the assignments and to practice for the final exam.
- **From Monday to Friday, there is an assignment due each day by 23:59.**
- Assignment submissions are done through ILIAS

## Who am I?

I am the Professor for Social and Behavioral Data Science at the University of Konstanz. My background is Computer Science but I worked my whole career with psychologists, sociologists and physicists 
to learn new ways to understand human behavior. I got my PhD from ETH Zurich in 2012 and a habilitation in 2018, starting to work as 
full professor TU Graz in 2020 and then at the University of Konstanz in 2022. To learn more about my work, check my
